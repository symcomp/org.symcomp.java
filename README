This is the org.symcomp Java library. The full documentation may be found
on http://java.symcomp.org/ .

-------------------
BUILDING THE THINGS
-------------------
Maven (http://maven.apache.org) is required to build the library. 
Once you have installed maven, simply type

  $ mvn install

to compile the relevant parts and install the jars into your local
maven repository. The documentation may be similarly compiled, by

  $ mvn javadoc:javadoc


----------------
USING THE THINGS
----------------
Examples of the use of the library may be found in

* framework-demo: Sample SCSCP server and clients,
* openmath-converter: Converting between different OpenMath representations 
  using the OpenMath library.

All these examples may be built by building the library first (as described
above) and the typing 

  $ mvn compile

in the corresponding directory.
