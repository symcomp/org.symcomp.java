OpenMath Converter

The purpose of this tool is to convert between different OpenMath
representations. It is using the org.symcomp.openmath library to do so
and supports import from and output to
* OpenMath 2.0 XML
* OpenMath 2.0 Binary
* OpenMath 2.0 compressed binary
* POPCORN

The app takes two arguments: <XML|BIN|CBIN|POP> infile
where the first arg determines the type of the output, and the
second is the input file. The format of the input file is determined
autmatically.

********* BUILDING *********

Prerequisites:
  * Java >= 5
  * Maven2, http://maven.apache.org/
  * the org.symcomp.openmath library
  all other dependencies are resolved by maven automagically

Getting the Sources:
  * If you're reading this, you have already got the sources.

Building:
  * in the basedir issue 'mvn install',
    this installs the libraries in you local maven-repository
    (whatever this is, don't care)
  * openmath-converter issue 'mvn compile'
    and see whether it all works out.
  * the run.sh-script does building and starting in one step

If you don't have a bash:
  *  openmath-converter issue
     'mvn assembly:assembly' and find a file
     target/openmath-converter-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar
  *  This, you can call the hard way:
     > java -jar target/openmath-converter-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar <XML|BIN|CBIN|POP> infile
